This comprehensive guide walks you through setting up webhooks in Pager, from basic configuration to advanced troubleshooting. Whether you're connecting your first service or managing multiple integrations, this guide has you covered.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Admin Access">
    You need **admin permissions** in your Pager workspace to create and manage webhooks
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Target Channel">
    Create or identify the channel where webhook notifications should be posted
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="External Service Access">
    Ensure you have admin access to the external service you want to integrate
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Webhook Limits

<Note>
  Each workspace has limits to ensure optimal performance:
  - **5 webhooks per service type** (GitHub, Linear, Jira, Stripe, Custom)
  - **25 total webhooks per workspace**
  - **1000 requests per hour per webhook**
  - **1MB maximum payload size**
</Note>

## Step-by-Step Setup Process

### Step 1: Navigate to Webhook Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Settings">
    In your Pager workspace, click on your workspace name in the top-left corner
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Webhook Management">
    Select **"Settings"** from the dropdown menu, then click **"Webhooks"** in the sidebar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Current Webhooks">
    You'll see a list of existing webhooks with their status, activity, and configuration details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create New Webhook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Creation">
    Click the **"Create Webhook"** button in the top-right corner
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Service Type">
    Choose from available integrations:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Supported Services">
        - **GitHub**: Repository events and development notifications
        - **Linear**: Issue tracking and project management updates  
        - **Jira**: Project management and issue tracking
        - **Stripe**: Payment events and subscription management
        - **Custom**: General-purpose webhooks for any service
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Selection Tips">
        - **Choose specific services** for better formatting and features
        - **Use Custom** for services not explicitly supported
        - **Consider future needs** when selecting service types
        - **Check limits** if approaching the 5-webhook limit per service
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Basic Settings">
    Fill in the webhook configuration:
    
    - **Webhook Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Backend Repo Updates", "Payment Alerts")
    - **Target Channel**: Select the channel for notifications
    - **Description**: Optional details about the webhook's purpose
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure Security (Signing Secret)

<Warning>
  **Security Best Practice**: Always use signing secrets for production webhooks to verify that requests come from the legitimate service.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="With Signing Secret (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable Signing Secret">
        Check the **"Use Signing Secret"** option during webhook creation
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Enter Secret">
        - **For most services**: Enter the signing secret from your external service
        - **For Stripe**: Leave empty initially, add after configuring Stripe
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Save Configuration">
        The signing secret will be used to verify webhook authenticity
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Without Signing Secret">
    <Warning>
      Only recommended for development/testing environments
    </Warning>
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Skip Secret">
        Leave the signing secret field empty
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Understand Risks">
        Webhooks without signing secrets cannot verify sender authenticity
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Monitor Activity">
        Regularly check webhook logs for suspicious activity
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 4: Copy Webhook URL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate URL">
    After creating the webhook, Pager generates a unique URL for your integration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy URL">
    Click the **"Copy URL"** button or copy the full webhook URL from the details page
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Secure Storage">
    Store the webhook URL securely - it's the endpoint your external service will use
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Webhook URLs are unique and cannot be changed after creation. If you need a different URL, you'll need to create a new webhook.
</Note>

### Step 5: Configure External Service

The configuration process varies by service. Here are general steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Service Settings">
    Log into your external service and navigate to webhook/integration settings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Webhook Endpoint">
    Create a new webhook endpoint using your Pager webhook URL
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Events">
    Select which events should trigger notifications to Pager
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Signing Secret">
    If using a signing secret, configure it in your external service
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Configuration">
    Most services offer a "test webhook" feature to verify the connection
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 6: Verify Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger Test Event">
    Create a test event in your external service (e.g., commit, issue, payment)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Pager Channel">
    Verify that the formatted notification appears in your designated channel
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Webhook Logs">
    In Pager webhook settings, check the activity logs for successful delivery
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate Formatting">
    Ensure the message format meets your team's needs
  </Step>
</Steps>
