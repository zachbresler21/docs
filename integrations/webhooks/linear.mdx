## Advanced Configuration

### Team-Specific Webhooks

For organizations with multiple Linear teams:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Team-Specific Webhooks">
    Set up separate Pager webhooks for different Linear teams
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Team Filters">
    In Linear webhook settings, you can filter events by team:
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Linear Webhook Filter
    {
      "url": "https://api.pager.team/webhooks/your-webhook-id",
      "enabled": true,
      "teamIds": ["team-engineering", "team-design"],
      "resourceTypes": ["Issue", "Comment", "Project"]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Channel Organization">
    Route different teams to different channels:
    - `#linear-engineering` - Engineering team updates
    - `#linear-design` - Design team updates  
    - `#linear-product` - Product team updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Project-Based Routing

For project-focused notifications:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Multiple Webhooks">
    **Best for**: Different channels per project
    
    Create separate webhooks for major projects and route to dedicated channels
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Single Webhook with Filtering">
    **Best for**: Centralized management
    
    Use one webhook and organize notifications within a single channel using Linear's project context
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Priority-Based Notifications

Configure different notification levels:

<CodeGroup>
```json High Priority Filter
{
  "resourceTypes": ["Issue", "Comment"],
  "action": ["create", "update"],
  "data": {
    "priority": {
      "$gte": 2
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Supported Events

Pager processes these Linear webhook events:

## Filtering and Customization

### Event Filtering

Linear provides powerful filtering options:

<CodeGroup>
```json Custom Event Filter
{
  "url": "https://api.pager.team/webhooks/your-webhook-id",
  "enabled": true,
  "resourceTypes": ["Issue", "Comment"],
  "teamIds": ["team-123", "team-456"],
  "projectIds": ["project-abc", "project-xyz"],
  "data": {
    "priority": {
      "$gte": 1
    },
    "state": {
      "type": {
        "$in": ["started", "completed"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Label-Based Routing

Route issues with specific labels to different channels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Label-Specific Webhooks">
    Set up different Pager webhooks for different label categories
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Linear Filters">
    Use Linear's data filtering to send only issues with specific labels
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Example Routing">
    - **bug** label ‚Üí `#bugs-and-issues`
    - **feature** label ‚Üí `#feature-development`  
    - **urgent** label ‚Üí `#critical-alerts`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook not receiving events">
    **Check these settings:**
    - Verify webhook URL is correct in Linear settings
    - Ensure webhook is enabled in Linear
    - Check that relevant events are selected in Linear webhook configuration
    - Verify signing secret matches between Linear and Pager
    
    **Debug steps:**
    - Test webhook using Linear's webhook test feature
    - Check Linear's webhook delivery logs
    - Review Pager webhook logs for incoming requests
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Signature verification failing">
    **Common causes:**
    - Signing secret mismatch between Linear and Pager
    - Special characters in signing secret not properly handled
    - Webhook payload modified by proxy or middleware
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Regenerate signing secret in Linear and update in Pager
    - Ensure signing secret is copied exactly without extra spaces
    - Check for URL encoding issues in the secret
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many notifications">
    **Optimization strategies:**
    - Use Linear's event filtering to reduce noise
    - Filter by priority levels (only high/urgent issues)
    - Exclude label change events if they create too much activity
    - Create separate channels for different notification types
    - Use team-specific filters to reduce cross-team noise
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing issue context">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Linear webhook payload doesn't include full issue context
    - Custom fields not included in webhook data
    - Project information not properly linked
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check Linear webhook payload in delivery logs
    - Ensure all relevant data is included in Linear's webhook configuration
    - Contact support if specific fields are missing from notifications
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Testing Webhook Delivery

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Linear's Test Feature">
    In Linear webhook settings, use the "Send test webhook" button to verify connectivity
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Trigger Real Events">
    - Create a test issue in Linear
    - Update an existing issue's status
    - Add a comment to an issue
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Delivery Logs">
    - Check Linear's webhook delivery logs for success/failure status
    - Review Pager webhook logs for processing confirmation
    - Verify message formatting in the target channel
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Workflow Organization
- **Separate channels** for different issue types (bugs vs features)
- **Priority-based filtering** to highlight urgent issues
- **Team-specific webhooks** for better organization
- **Consistent naming** for Linear-related channels

### Notification Management
- **Filter by priority** to reduce notification overload
- **Exclude low-impact events** like label changes for non-critical issues
- **Use Linear's built-in filters** rather than managing filtering in Pager
- **Regular review** of notification volume and team feedback

### Team Collaboration
- **Include relevant team members** in Linear notification channels
- **Use Linear issue URLs** for quick access to full context
- **Establish response workflows** for different issue priorities
- **Regular cleanup** of completed issues and outdated notifications
