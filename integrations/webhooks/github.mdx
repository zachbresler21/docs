## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create GitHub Webhook in Pager

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Webhooks">
    In your Pager workspace, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Event Filtering

For teams that want more control over notifications:

<CodeGroup>
```json GitHub Webhook Configuration
{
  "events": [
    "push",
    "pull_request", 
    "issues",
    "pull_request_review",
    "release",
    "workflow_run"
  ],
  "active": true,
  "config": {
    "url": "https://api.pager.team/webhooks/your-webhook-id",
    "content_type": "json",
    "secret": "your-signing-secret",
    "insecure_ssl": "0"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Branch-Specific Notifications

To get notifications only for specific branches:

<Note>
  GitHub doesn't support branch filtering at the webhook level, but you can create separate webhooks for different repositories or use GitHub Actions to filter and forward events.
</Note>

### Organization-Level Webhooks

For organizations managing multiple repositories:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Organization Settings">
    Go to your GitHub organization settings ‚Üí **Webhooks**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Organization Webhook">
    Add a webhook that will receive events from all organization repositories
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Event Scope">
    Select events and repositories that should trigger notifications
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Events

Pager processes these GitHub webhook events:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository Events">
    - **push** - Commits pushed to any branch
    - **create** - Branch or tag creation
    - **delete** - Branch or tag deletion
    - **fork** - Repository forked
    - **watch** - Repository starred
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pull Request Events">
    - **pull_request** - PR opened, closed, merged, synchronized
    - **pull_request_review** - Reviews submitted, edited, dismissed
    - **pull_request_review_comment** - Comments on PR reviews
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Issue Events">
    - **issues** - Issue opened, closed, edited, assigned
    - **issue_comment** - Comments on issues
    - **label** - Labels added or removed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Release & Deployment">

    - **workflow_dispatch** - Manual workflow triggered
    - **check_run** - Check run completed
    - **check_suite** - Check suite completed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook not receiving events">
    **Check these settings:**
    - Verify the webhook URL is correct in GitHub
    - Ensure the webhook is marked as "Active" in GitHub
    - Check that events are selected in GitHub webhook settings
    - Verify network connectivity and firewall settings
    
    **Debug steps:**
    - Review recent deliveries in GitHub webhook settings
    - Check webhook logs in Pager dashboard
    - Test with a simple push event
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Signature verification failing">
    **Common causes:**
    - Signing secret mismatch between GitHub and Pager
    - Webhook payload modified by proxy or firewall
    - Incorrect HMAC-SHA256 signature calculation
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Regenerate and update the signing secret in both systems
    - Verify no middleware is modifying the payload
    - Check GitHub's webhook delivery logs for signature details
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Messages not appearing in channel">
    **Check these items:**
    - Verify the target channel exists and is accessible
    - Ensure the webhook user has permission to post in the channel
    - Check if messages are being filtered or blocked
    - Review channel notification settings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many notifications">
    **Optimization strategies:**
    - Reduce selected events to only essential ones
    - Use branch protection rules to limit push notifications
    - Create separate channels for different types of notifications
    - Consider organization-level webhooks for better filtering
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Testing Webhook Delivery

To test your GitHub webhook:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use GitHub's Test Feature">
    In your GitHub webhook settings, click "Recent Deliveries" then "Redeliver" for any previous delivery
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Trigger Real Events">
    - Make a commit to trigger push events
    - Create or comment on an issue
    - Open a pull request
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Pager Logs">
    Check the webhook logs in your Pager dashboard for delivery confirmation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Repository Organization
- **Create dedicated channels** for different repositories or teams
- **Use consistent naming** for repository-specific channels (e.g., #repo-backend-api)
- **Separate high-traffic repos** to avoid notification overload

### Event Selection
- **Start minimal** with just push and pull request events
- **Add events gradually** based on team needs
- **Avoid workflow_run events** for repositories with frequent CI/CD runs

### Security
- **Always use signing secrets** in production environments
- **Rotate secrets regularly** as part of security maintenance
- **Monitor webhook activity** for unusual patterns
- **Use repository-specific secrets** for better security isolation

## Multiple Repository Setup

For teams managing multiple repositories:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Individual Webhooks">
    **Pros**: Granular control, dedicated channels
    **Cons**: More management overhead
    
    Create separate Pager webhooks for each repository with repository-specific channels.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Organization Webhook">
    **Pros**: Centralized management, single configuration
    **Cons**: All repos in one channel (unless filtered)
    
    Use GitHub organization webhooks to capture all repository events.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid Approach">
    **Best of both**: Important repos get dedicated channels, others share a general channel
    
    Combine individual webhooks for key repositories with an organization webhook for others.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
