AI Agents are one of Pager's most powerful and unique features. These intelligent assistants integrate seamlessly into your team conversations, providing contextual help, searching through your message history, and offering insights based on your workspace's collective knowledge.

## What Are AI Agents?

AI Agents in Pager are context-aware assistants powered by OpenAI's latest models. Unlike traditional chatbots, these agents understand your team's communication patterns, can search through your entire message history, and provide personalized responses based on your workspace's unique context.

## Using AI Agents Effectively

### Mention Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Direct Questions">
    ```markdown
    @Team Assistant what did we decide about the database migration?
    @DevBot can you find the deployment checklist we created?
    @Project Oracle what are the current blockers for the mobile app?
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Context-Heavy Queries">
    ```markdown
    @Team Assistant I'm looking for the conversation where Sarah mentioned 
    the API rate limiting issue. It was sometime last month.
    
    @Knowledge Keeper can you help our new developer understand our code 
    review process? Include any examples from recent discussions.
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Proactive Assistance">
    ```markdown
    @Project Oracle we're planning the Q2 roadmap. Can you summarize what 
    we learned from Q1 retrospectives?
    
    @DevBot I'm working on the authentication system. What security 
    considerations did the team discuss previously?
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Best Practices for Agent Interaction

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Provide Context">
    **Good**: "Find the discussion about API authentication where John mentioned security concerns"
    **Better**: "Find the API authentication discussion from last week where John raised security concerns about JWT tokens"
    
    The more context you provide, the more accurate and helpful the agent's response will be.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be Specific About Timeframes">
    **Vague**: "What did we discuss about the mobile app?"
    **Specific**: "What mobile app decisions did we make in the last two weeks?"
    
    Time-specific queries help the agent focus on the most relevant information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ask Follow-up Questions">
    Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or additional information:
    ```markdown
    @Team Assistant can you find more details about that database issue?
    @DevBot what was the final resolution for the deployment problem?
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Agents for Onboarding">
    AI agents are excellent for helping new team members:
    ```markdown
    @Knowledge Keeper can you help @new-developer understand our Git workflow?
    @Project Oracle what are the current project priorities for new contributors?
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

```markdown
ðŸ‘¤ @Team Assistant help me understand our current API rate limiting approach

ðŸ¤– Team Assistant is thinking...

ðŸ¤– Let me search for recent discussions about API rate limiting...

ðŸ¤– I found several relevant conversations. Here's what I discovered:

**Current Rate Limiting Approach:**
- Using Redis-based rate limiting with sliding window algorithm
- Configured for 1000 requests/hour per API key
- Different tiers for free (100/hour) vs paid users (1000/hour)

**Recent Discussions:**
- Sarah mentioned in #backend-dev (3 days ago) that we might need to adjust limits for enterprise customers
- John shared performance metrics showing current limits are working well
- The team decided to implement rate limit headers for better client integration

**Next Steps Mentioned:**
- Add rate limit monitoring dashboard
- Consider implementing burst allowances for certain endpoints

Would you like me to find more details about any specific aspect?
